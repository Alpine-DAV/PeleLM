          <h4>Lean premixed hydrogen combustion</h4>

            Combustion of an ultra-lean hydrogen-air mixture.  Here, the domain is a rectangular region, and the mean flow of fuel is indicated by the arrow.  The lateral domain boundaries are re-entrant (periodic), and hot combustion products exit the back of the domain. The animation shows the evolution of a temperature isotherm colored with the local rate of fuel consumption, and indicates that the flame only lives on regions of the isotherm with positive mean curvature (the center of curvature of the surface is in the products).  Moreover, it is apparent that leading point sections "shadow" regions downstream.  The inflow is unform so the flmae dynamics are driven entirely by this so-called thermo-diffusive instability.  Also, the mean inflow is continuous adjusted to keep the mean flame position constant in the box.

          <h4>Low swirl burner</h4>
          <p><span class="image left">

  Low-swirl burners (LSB) are emerging as an important technology for meeting design requirements in terms of both reliability and emissions for next generation combustion devices. The low-swirl burner concept is extremely simple: premixed fuel exits a pipe after passing through a turbulence generation plate and an annular set of curved vanes.  A detached premixed flame anchors in the diverging flow above the pipe exit.  Turbulence in fuel stream wrinkles the flame, which enhances the overall rate of combustion in the device.</p>

PeleLM has been used to simulate lean hydrogen and methane flames at the full scale of the laboratory experiments, and the results were probed to explore the details of flame stability and emissions production.</p>
